#These are emotes from a server made specifically to house the bot emotes - it's very unlikely they will get deleted, but if you want to, you can replace them with your own.
#To easily get the name+id of the emote to throw it in here, in discord type in the name of the emote but place a "\" before it
#So, to get the :yes: emote you would type in \:yes:


yes = "<:yes:1029272413294313482>" #btw this emote is absolutely cursed, full pic here: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/958762296589582447/974592105634738196/SPOILER_unknown.png
